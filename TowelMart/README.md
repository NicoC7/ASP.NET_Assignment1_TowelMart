10:28 I have been working in the assignment, right now im adding the filter capability but I really need to fix the link to my towelmart page. Im tired of having to manually type type it in the url so for now I havent encountered a major problem. I creted a folder to add the images of my products and I dont know how to add them.

10:50 I have encountered a problem that I couldnt be able to solve. so im trying to add a the search by sizes with the dropdown but I cant solve the issue.

11:20 The Title of my project is my color and the Genre is my size. This properties are for the searching capability. Hopefully I can solve the issue with the dropdown menu for the size propertie.

11:31 The issue still poping out "An unhandled exception occurred while processing the request." So I would add that part later.

11:36 I will change the lab because I cant focus. I couldnt fin a solution to my code so I commented out the new code added so I can see if it at least works.

12:34 here we go again...

12:53 I finally solved the issue. I just was miss spelling one property and also I had to update the data base.

12:56 I will start to work on the validations..

1:25 I add some more validations aven to display name so it look user friendly as you said.

1:42 I add more towels into my database I think I will try to display the img and start doing the styling.
